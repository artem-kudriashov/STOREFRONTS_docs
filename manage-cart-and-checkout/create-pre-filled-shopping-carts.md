# Create pre-filled shopping carts

Checkout API allows you to create URLs that open a shopping cart and fill it with products and delivery details. Use it for promotions or sharing pre-filled carts with customers. The whole process happens in a JavaScript file and results in a shopping cart URL that you can share with customers or post on social media.

### Pre-requirements

Your website must load the following files below the store widget. Both of them are required for the feature to work:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ecwid-addons/apps/ecwid-cart-app/cartapp.css">
<script src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ecwid-addons/apps/ecwid-cart-app/cart.js"></script>
```

### Create a cart-generating URL with JavaScript

You need to create a JSON with cart details, convert it to a string, and then encode it to URI format. The cart structure used in this method matches the one from REST API and cart management methods.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only the `products` field is required for the method to work.
{% endhint %}

Once you have a variable with cart JSON, use `JSON.stringify()` method to convert it to a string, then encode it with the `encodeURIComponent()` method.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use a Wix website, you need an additional encoding to base64 format with `btoa()` method before using `encodeURIComponent()`.
{% endhint %}

With the cart encoded to a `cartCode` variable, you can compose a link that opens a shopping cart and fills it with products and address details.

```javascript
var cartPageLink = "https://mywebsite.com/store#!/~/cart/create=";

var cartItems = [{
    "id": 66821181, // ID of the product in Ecwid
    "quantity": 3, // Quantity of products to add
    "options": { // Specify product options
        "Color": "White",
        "Size":"11oz"
    }
}, {
    "id": 66722581,
    "quantity": 5
}];

var cart = {
     "gotoCheckout": true, // go to next checkout step right away (after 'Cart' page)
     "products": cartItems, // products to add to cart
