# Storefront customization options

With Ecwid, you can customize your storefront even without coding knowledge though no-code options are limited. However, JavaScript offers much more customization allowing you to write custom logic for the storefront or even change the existing one.

There are 3 ways to change the storefront looks and feels depending on your dev skills:

### No-code storefront customization

Ecwid offers a wide range of layout and design settings in the admin panel to tailor the storefront for your needs, including:

* **Site templates**: Choose from a variety of carefully pre-designed store templates for different business niches and customize them with texts, colors, fonts, layouts, and images to match your brand identity.\

### Apply configuration settings without JavaScript Code

In addition to the no-code options in the Ecwid admin, various configuration settings allow you to customize your storefront's design and functionality without writing JavaScript code.&#x20;

These settings can be applied by adding them to the HTML integration code of your website or special fields in Ecwid admin.

### Custom JavaScript code and Ecwid JS API

Advanced storefront customization requires you to write JavaScript code. With JS, you have mostly unlimited options for enhancing your storefront with additional features and custom logic.&#x20;

Ecwid also provides a free tool called **Ecwid JS API** that allows developers to easily track certain storefront events like a new customer login or a page load, and get details about the store, applications, or customers without backend requests.&#x20;

With JavaScript, you can:

* **Create custom widgets and features**: add unique functionality to your storefront, such as promo popups, countdown timers, or custom search filters.
* **Integrate with third-party services**: Track customer activity with JS API and send live data to third-party services such as email marketing platforms or loyalty programs.
* **Customize the checkout process**: Enhance your customer's checkout experience by adding custom logic, drawing delivery map widgets, or showing additional details upon the order placement.
